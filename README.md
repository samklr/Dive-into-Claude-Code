> **A comprehensive source-level architectural analysis of Claude Code (v2.1.88, ~1,900 TypeScript files, ~512K lines of code), combined with a curated collection of community analyses, a design-space guide for agent builders, and cross-system comparisons.**

> [!TIP]
> **TL;DR** -- Only 1.6% of Claude Code's codebase is AI decision logic. The other 98.4% is deterministic infrastructure -- permission gates, context management, tool routing, and recovery logic. The agent loop is a simple while-loop; the real engineering complexity lives in the systems around it. This repo dissects that architecture and distills it into actionable design guidance for anyone building AI agent systems.

## Key Highlights

- **98.4% Infrastructure, 1.6% AI** -- The agent loop is a simple while-loop; the real complexity is permission gates, context management, and recovery logic.
- **5 Values → 13 Principles → Implementation** -- Every design choice traces back to human authority, safety, reliability, capability, and adaptability.
- **Defense in Depth with Shared Failure Modes** -- 7 safety layers, but all share performance constraints. 50+ subcommands bypass security analysis.
- **4 CVEs Reveal a Pre-Trust Window** -- Extensions execute *before* the trust dialog appears.
- **The Cross-Cutting Harness Resists Reimplementation** -- The loop is easy to copy; hooks, classifier, compaction, and isolation are not.

<summary><h2>Architecture at a Glance</h2></summary>

Claude Code answers **four design questions** that every production coding agent must face:

| Question | Claude Code's Answer |
|:---------|:---------------------|
| Where does reasoning live? | Model reasons; harness enforces. ~1.6% AI, 98.4% infrastructure. |
| How many execution engines? | One `queryLoop` for all interfaces (CLI, SDK, IDE). |
| Default safety posture? | Deny-first: deny > ask > allow. Strictest rule wins. |
| Binding resource constraint? | ~200K (older models) / 1M (Claude 4.6 series) context window. 5 compaction layers before every model call. |

The system decomposes into **7 components** (User → Interfaces → Agent Loop → Permission System → Tools → State & Persistence → Execution Environment) across **5 architectural layers**.

<summary><h2>Values and Design Principles</h2></summary>

The architecture traces from **5 human values** through **13 design principles** to implementation:

| Value | Core Idea |
|:------|:----------|
| **Human Decision Authority** | Humans retain control via principal hierarchy. When a 93% prompt-approval rate revealed approval fatigue, response was restructured boundaries, not more warnings. |
| **Safety, Security, Privacy** | System protects even when human vigilance lapses. 7 independent safety layers. |
| **Reliable Execution** | Does what was meant. Gather-act-verify loop. Graceful recovery. |
| **Capability Amplification** | "A Unix utility, not a product." 98.4% is deterministic infrastructure enabling the model. |
| **Contextual Adaptability** | CLAUDE.md hierarchy, graduated extensibility, trust trajectories that evolve over time. |

<details>
<summary><b>The 13 Design Principles</b></summary>

| Principle | Design Question |
|:----------|:----------------|
| Deny-first with human escalation | Should unrecognized actions be allowed, blocked, or escalated? |
| Graduated trust spectrum | Fixed permission level, or spectrum users traverse over time? |
| Defense in depth | Single safety boundary, or multiple overlapping ones? |
| Externalized programmable policy | Hardcoded policy, or externalized configs with lifecycle hooks? |
| Context as scarce resource | Single-pass truncation or graduated pipeline? |
| Append-only durable state | Mutable state, snapshots, or append-only logs? |
| Minimal scaffolding, maximal harness | Invest in scaffolding or operational infrastructure? |
| Values over rules | Rigid procedures or contextual judgment with deterministic guardrails? |
| Composable multi-mechanism extensibility | One API or layered mechanisms at different costs? |
| Reversibility-weighted risk assessment | Same oversight for all, or lighter for reversible actions? |
| Transparent file-based config and memory | Opaque DB, embeddings, or user-visible files? |
| Isolated subagent boundaries | Shared context/permissions, or isolation? |
| Graceful recovery and resilience | Fail hard, or recover silently? |

</details>

The paper also applies a **sixth evaluative lens** -- long-term capability preservation -- citing evidence that developers in AI-assisted conditions score 17% lower on comprehension tests.

<summary><h2>The Agentic Query Loop</h2></summary>

<p align="center">
  <img src="./assets/iteration.png" width="60%" alt="Runtime turn flow">
</p>

The core is a **ReAct-pattern while-loop**: assemble context → call model → dispatch tools → check permissions → execute → repeat. Implemented as an `AsyncGenerator` yielding streaming events.

**Before every model call**, five compaction shapers run sequentially (cheapest first): Budget Reduction → Snip → Microcompact → Context Collapse → Auto-Compact.

**9-step pipeline per turn:** Settings resolution → State init → Context assembly → 5 pre-model shapers → Model call → Tool dispatch → Permission gate → Tool execution → Stop condition

**Two execution paths:**
- `StreamingToolExecutor` -- begins executing tools as they stream in (latency optimization)
- Fallback `runTools` -- classifies tools as concurrent-safe or exclusive

**Recovery:** Max output token escalation (3 retries), reactive compaction (once per turn), prompt-too-long handling, streaming fallback, fallback model

**5 stop conditions:** No tool use, max turns, context overflow, hook intervention, explicit abort

<p align="right"><a href="#dive-into-claude-code-the-design-space-of-todays-ai-agent-system">↑ Back to top</a></p>

</details>

---

<details>
<summary><h2>Safety and Permissions</h2></summary>

<p align="center">
  <img src="./assets/permission.png" width="75%" alt="Permission gate">
</p>

**7 permission modes** form a graduated trust spectrum: `plan` → `default` → `acceptEdits` → `auto` (ML classifier) → `dontAsk` → `bypassPermissions` (+ internal `bubble`).

**Deny-first**: A broad deny *always* overrides a narrow allow. **7 independent safety layers** from tool pre-filtering through shell sandboxing to hook interception. Permissions are **never restored on resume** -- trust is re-established per session.

> [!WARNING]
> **Shared failure modes:** Defense-in-depth degrades when layers share constraints. Per-subcommand parsing causes event-loop starvation -- commands exceeding 50 subcommands bypass security analysis entirely to prevent the REPL from freezing.

<details>
<summary><b>More details: authorization pipeline, auto-mode classifier, CVEs</b></summary>

**Authorization pipeline:** Pre-filtering (strip denied tools) → PreToolUse hooks → Deny-first rule evaluation → Permission handler (4 branches: coordinator, swarm worker, speculative classifier, interactive)

**Auto-mode classifier** (`yoloClassifier.ts`): Separate LLM call with internal/external permission templates. Two-stage: fast-filter + chain-of-thought.

**Pre-trust execution window:** 2 patched CVEs share this root cause -- hooks and MCP servers execute during initialization *before* the trust dialog appears, creating a structurally privileged attack window outside the deny-first pipeline.

<details>
<summary><h2>Extensibility</h2></summary>

<p align="center">
  <img src="./assets/extensibility.png" width="85%" alt="Three injection points: assemble, model, execute">
</p>

**Four mechanisms at graduated context costs:** Hooks (zero) → Skills (low) → Plugins (medium) → MCP (high). Three injection points in the agent loop: **assemble()** (what the model sees), **model()** (what it can reach), **execute()** (whether/how actions run).

**Tool pool assembly** (5-step): Base enumeration (up to 54 tools) → Mode filtering → Deny pre-filtering → MCP integration → Deduplication

**27 hook events** across 5 categories with 4 execution types (shell, LLM-evaluated, webhook, subagent verifier)

**Plugin manifest** accepts 10 component types: commands, agents, skills, hooks, MCP servers, LSP servers, output styles, channels, settings, user config

**Skills:** SKILL.md with 15+ YAML frontmatter fields. Key difference -- SkillTool injects into current context; AgentTool spawns isolated context.

</details>

<details>
<summary><h2>Context and Memory</h2></summary>

<p align="center">
  <img src="./assets/context.png" width="95%" alt="Context construction">
</p>

**9 ordered sources** build the context window. CLAUDE.md instructions are delivered as **user context** (probabilistic compliance), not system prompt (deterministic). Memory is **file-based** (no vector DB) -- fully inspectable, editable, version-controllable.

**4-level CLAUDE.md hierarchy:** Managed (`/etc/`) → User (`~/.claude/`) → Project (`CLAUDE.md`, `.claude/rules/`) → Local (`CLAUDE.local.md`, gitignored)

**5-layer compaction** (graduated lazy-degradation): Budget reduction → Snip → Microcompact → Context Collapse (read-time projection, non-destructive) → Auto-Compact (full model summary, last resort)

**Memory retrieval:** LLM-based scan of memory-file headers, selects up to 5 relevant files. No embeddings, no vector similarity.

<p align="right"><a href="#dive-into-claude-code-the-design-space-of-todays-ai-agent-system">↑ Back to top</a></p>

</details>

---

<details>
<summary><h2>Subagent Delegation</h2></summary>

<p align="center">
  <img src="./assets/subagent.png" width="90%" alt="Subagent architecture">
</p>

**6 built-in types** (Explore, Plan, General-purpose, Guide, Verification, Statusline) + custom agents via `.claude/agents/*.md`. **Sidechain transcripts**: only summaries return to parent (parent's context is *protected* from subagent verbosity). Three isolation modes: worktree, remote, in-process. Coordination via POSIX `flock()`.

**SkillTool vs AgentTool:** SkillTool injects into current context (cheap). AgentTool spawns isolated context (expensive, but prevents context explosion).

**Permission override:** Subagent `permissionMode` applies UNLESS parent is in `bypassPermissions`/`acceptEdits`/`auto` (explicit user decisions always take precedence).

**Custom agents:** YAML frontmatter supports tools, disallowedTools, model, effort, permissionMode, mcpServers, hooks, maxTurns, skills, memory scope, background flag, isolation mode.

<details>
<summary><h2>Session Persistence</h2></summary>

<p align="center">
  <img src="./assets/session_compact.png" width="75%" alt="Session persistence and context compaction">
</p>

Three channels: append-only JSONL transcripts, global prompt history, subagent sidechains. **Permissions never restored on resume** -- trust is re-established per session. Design favors **auditability over query power**.

**Chain patching:** Compact boundaries record `headUuid`/`anchorUuid`/`tailUuid`. The session loader patches the message chain at read time. Nothing is destructively edited on disk.

**Checkpoints:** File-history checkpoints for `--rewind-files`, stored at `~/.claude/file-history/<sessionId>/`.

<summary><h2>New Signals in the Agent Design Space</h2></summary>

New agent-system developments reinforce the same lesson Claude Code makes clear: agent capability is not a model property alone. It comes from the runtime, context layer, execution boundary, tool supply chain, the controls humans have over it, and the evaluation loop around the model.

| Design Implication | What it means for agent builders | Representative signals |
|:---|:---|:---|
| **Runtime and control plane are first-class design concerns** | Durable execution, checkpoints, sandboxes, agent inventory, policy, and observability should be designed as parts of the system that users can see, not hidden deployment details. | [Cursor cloud agents](https://cursor.com/blog/cloud-agent-lessons), [Google Managed Agents](https://blog.google/innovation-and-ai/technology/developers-tools/managed-agents-gemini-api/), [Microsoft Agent 365](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/security/blog/2026/05/01/microsoft-agent-365-now-generally-available-expands-capabilities-and-integrations/), [Databricks Omnigent](https://www.databricks.com/blog/introducing-omnigent-meta-harness-combine-control-and-share-your-agents) |
| **Context is managed infrastructure** | Prompts, files, skills, IDE indexes, workspace state, memory namespaces, and interpreter state need lifecycle, provenance, review, and rollback. | [LangChain Context Hub](https://www.langchain.com/blog/introducing-context-hub), [AWS AgentCore](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/machine-learning/break-the-context-window-barrier-with-amazon-bedrock-agentcore/), [Anthropic managed-agent memory](https://platform.claude.com/docs/en/managed-agents/memory) |
| **Execution boundary is the safety boundary** | Permissions, network reachability, filesystem access, credential custody, tenant isolation, and OS sandboxing are core architecture, not late-stage hardening. | [Codex Windows sandbox](https://openai.com/index/building-codex-windows-sandbox/), [Running Codex safely](https://openai.com/index/running-codex-safely/), [Anthropic self-hosted sandboxes](https://platform.claude.com/docs/en/managed-agents/self-hosted-sandboxes) |
| **Tools and skills are a supply chain** | MCP servers, skills, plugins, and agent-to-agent protocols need registries, allowlists, identity, semantic review, versioning, and revocation. | [NSA MCP security](https://www.nsa.gov/Portals/75/documents/Cybersecurity/CSI_MCP_SECURITY.pdf), [GitHub MCP allowlists](https://github.blog/changelog/2026-04-16-copilot-cli-supports-custom-registry-based-mcp-allowlists/), [A2A milestone](https://www.linuxfoundation.org/press/a2a-protocol-surpasses-150-organizations-lands-in-major-cloud-platforms-and-sees-enterprise-production-use-in-first-year) |
| **Humans become managers and verifiers** | Agent products should support goals, plans, approvals, interrupts, reviewable diffs, escalation, and constrained multi-agent write authority. | [Codex from anywhere](https://openai.com/index/work-with-codex-from-anywhere/), [Copilot cloud agent](https://github.blog/changelog/2026-04-01-research-plan-and-code-with-copilot-cloud-agent), [Cognition multi-agents](https://cognition.ai/blog/multi-agents-working) |
| **Observability must close the improvement loop** | Traces should feed evaluation, failure clustering, policy enforcement, and prompt/tool repair rather than ending as passive logs. | [LangSmith Engine](https://www.langchain.com/blog/how-we-built-langsmith-engine-our-agent-for-improving-agents), [OpenAI agent improvement loop](https://developers.openai.com/cookbook/examples/agents_sdk/agent_improvement_loop), [AWS AgentCore Evaluations](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/machine-learning/build-reliable-ai-agents-with-amazon-bedrock-agentcore-evaluations/) |

These signals do not replace Claude Code's design space; they make its boundaries clearer. The agent loop is the small part. The harness around it is where most capability, safety, and reliability decisions now live.

<summary><h2>Build Your Own AI Agent: A Design Guide</h2></summary>

> Not a coding tutorial. A guide to the **design decisions** you must make, derived from architectural analysis.

Every production agent must navigate these decisions:

| Decision | The Question | Key Insight |
|:---------|:-------------|:------------|
| [**Reasoning placement**](./docs/build-your-own-agent.md#decision-1-where-does-reasoning-live) | How much logic in the model vs. harness? | As models converge in capability, the harness becomes the differentiator. |
| [**Safety posture**](./docs/build-your-own-agent.md#decision-2-what-is-your-safety-posture) | How do you prevent harmful actions? | Defense-in-depth fails when layers share failure modes. |
| [**Context management**](./docs/build-your-own-agent.md#decision-3-how-do-you-manage-context) | What does the model see? | Design for context scarcity from day one. Graduated > single-pass. |
| [**Extensibility**](./docs/build-your-own-agent.md#decision-4-how-do-you-handle-extensibility) | How do extensions plug in? | Not all extensions need to consume context tokens. |
| [**Subagent architecture**](./docs/build-your-own-agent.md#decision-5-how-do-subagents-work) | Shared or isolated context? | Agent teams in plan mode cost ~7× tokens. Subagent summary-only returns prevent context blow-up. |

<summary><h2>Cross-System Comparison: Claude Code vs OpenClaw vs Hermes-Agent</h2></summary>

The same recurring design questions admit different architectural answers when the deployment context changes. The table below contrasts Claude Code v2.1.88 with two notable peers — [OpenClaw](https://github.com/openclaw/openclaw), a local-first multi-channel personal-assistant gateway, and [NousResearch/hermes-agent](https://github.com/NousResearch/hermes-agent), a self-improving multi-deployment agent — across the six design dimensions Section 10 of the paper uses for the OpenClaw comparison. Cells are source-grounded; this is not a feature scoreboard.

| Design Dimension | Claude Code (v2.1.88) [![Star](https://img.shields.io/github/stars/anthropics/claude-code.svg?style=social&label=Star)](https://github.com/anthropics/claude-code) | OpenClaw [![Star](https://img.shields.io/github/stars/openclaw/openclaw.svg?style=social&label=Star)](https://github.com/openclaw/openclaw) | Hermes-Agent [![Star](https://img.shields.io/github/stars/NousResearch/hermes-agent.svg?style=social&label=Star)](https://github.com/NousResearch/hermes-agent) |
|:---|:---|:---|:---|
| **System scope & deployment** | Per-user CLI / SDK / IDE interface for coding; one `queryLoop` async generator across entry points. | Local-first WebSocket gateway (default port 18789, loopback-bound by default; other binds available); routes ~23 messaging channels to an embedded agent runtime; companion apps for macOS, iOS, Android. | Three entry points: `hermes` (interactive CLI), `hermes-agent` (programmatic runtime), `hermes-acp` (ACP server); gateway adapters route messages to per-session AIAgent instances cached LRU-style (max 128, 1 h idle TTL); also runs as MCP server via `hermes mcp serve`. |
| **Trust model & security** | Deny-first per-action evaluation; 7 permission modes; LLM-based auto-mode classifier (`yoloClassifier` / `sideQuery`); session-scoped permission state (session bypass flag, app allowlist state) is not restored on resume. | Single trusted operator per gateway; DM pairing codes, sender allowlists, gateway authentication; per-agent allow / deny tool policy; opt-in sandboxing via Docker / SSH / OpenShell, off by default; `non-main` mode sandboxes only non-main sessions; hostile multi-tenant isolation explicitly not supported. | Dangerous-command pattern detection with per-session approval state; CLI interactive prompts and gateway async prompts; auxiliary-LLM smart approval auto-approves low-risk commands; permanent allowlist persisted in `config.yaml`; subagent worker threads default to auto-deny dangerous commands (opt-in `subagent_auto_approve` for batch / cron runs). |
| **Agent runtime & tools** | Single `queryLoop` async generator with streamed event yields; environment- and feature-gated tool registry; before-API compaction (Snip, Microcompact, Context Collapse, Auto-Compact) runs conditionally, with Auto-Compact first attempting session-memory compaction. | Embedded agent runtime inside the gateway's RPC dispatch (the `agent` RPC validates parameters, accepts immediately, runs asynchronously, and streams lifecycle / stream events back over the gateway protocol); per-session queue serialization with an optional global lane. | While-loop with explicit per-turn iteration budget and grace-call slot; per-turn checkpoint dedup; gateway `step_callback` hook fires on each iteration; auxiliary-model context compression summarizes middle turns while protecting head and tail. |
| **Extension architecture** | Four mechanisms at graduated context cost: hooks → skills → plugins → MCP; 27 hook events; 10 plugin component types. | Manifest-first plugin system with 12 documented capability categories; central registry exposes tools, channels, provider setup, hooks, HTTP routes, CLI commands, services; separate skills layer with multiple sources (workspace highest precedence) plus the ClawHub public registry; `openclaw mcp` provides both an MCP server interface and an outbound client registry for other MCP servers. | 12 bundled plugins under `plugins/` (context_engine, disk-cleanup, example-dashboard, google_meet, hermes-achievements, image_gen, kanban, memory, observability, platforms, spotify, strike-freedom-cockpit); MCP server (`mcp_serve.py`) exposes 10 tools; ACP adapter (`acp_adapter/`) exposes Hermes as an ACP server. |
| **Memory & context** | 4-level CLAUDE.md hierarchy; before-API compaction (Snip, Microcompact, Context Collapse, Auto-Compact); LLM-based selection from file-based Markdown memory files. | Workspace bootstrap files (AGENTS.md, SOUL.md, TOOLS.md, IDENTITY.md, USER.md) plus conditional BOOTSTRAP.md / HEARTBEAT.md / MEMORY.md; separate memory system (MEMORY.md, daily notes under `memory/YYYY-MM-DD.md`, optional DREAMS.md); hybrid vector + keyword search when an embedding provider is configured; experimental dreaming for long-term promotion; pluggable compaction providers. | SQLite state store with FTS5 full-text search and WAL-mode concurrent readers; sessions linked by `parent_session_id` chains for compression-triggered splits; 8 swappable memory backends under `plugins/memory/` (byterover, hindsight, holographic, honcho, mem0, openviking, retaindb, supermemory); auxiliary-LLM compression as a separate context-management layer. |
| **Multi-agent architecture** | Sub-agent delegation via sidechain transcripts; 6 built-in agent definitions (availability conditional on build / mode) plus custom; a single summary message returns to parent (in-process / viewable transcript cases preserve more internal detail); agent-isolation settings include `worktree` and `remote`, with an `in-process` teammate backend in the swarm path. | Two layers. (1) Multi-agent routing: per-channel isolated agents with their own workspace, auth profiles, session store, and model configuration, dispatched via deterministic binding rules. (2) Sub-agent delegation: `maxSpawnDepth` range 1–5, default 1, recommended 2; tool policy varies by depth; project vision (VISION.md) rejects agent-hierarchy frameworks as the default. | `delegate_task` tool spawns child AIAgent instances in a `ThreadPoolExecutor` (parent blocks until children complete); each child has fresh conversation history, its own `task_id`, and a restricted toolset (`DELEGATE_BLOCKED_TOOLS` strips `delegate_task`, `clarify`, `memory`, `send_message`, `execute_code`); default depth `MAX_DEPTH = 1` (configurable up to cap 3); default 3 concurrent children. |

**What this contrast reveals.** Three observations follow from the table. First, **deployment context** drives the rest of the design: a per-user coding CLI converges on per-action approval and a single execution loop, a multi-channel gateway converges on perimeter trust and channel-bound agents, and a multi-deployment messaging-and-cloud agent converges on opt-in container/cloud isolation, an LLM-based smart approval, and a swappable-backend memory layer. Second, the **extension layer is where each system most clearly differentiates**: Claude Code stratifies four mechanisms by context cost, OpenClaw treats extension as registry-managed capabilities at the gateway, and Hermes-Agent ships bundled plugins plus dual MCP server / ACP server interfaces other agents can connect to. Third, **memory architectures sit on a spectrum**: file-based and inspectable Markdown (Claude Code), file-based plus optional vector + experimental dreaming (OpenClaw), or full-text indexed (FTS5) plus eight swappable plugin backends including dedicated vector / RAG providers (Hermes-Agent). The table is best read not as a scoreboard but as three different fixed points in the same design space.

| [Addy Osmani — "Agent Harness Engineering"](https://addyosmani.com/blog/agent-harness-engineering/) | Frames harness engineering as a discipline with named primitives (filesystem/git state, sandboxes, AGENTS.md memory, compaction, planning loops, hooks); cites Claude Code as the canonical mature example. |
| [Addy Osmani — "Loop Engineering"](https://addyosmani.com/blog/loop-engineering/) | The essay that named "loop engineering": instead of writing prompts for the agent yourself, you build the loop that prompts it for you. Its parts (automations, worktrees, skills, connectors, sub-agents, and a file that tracks progress) are the harness pieces this paper analyzes. |
| [Armin Ronacher — "The Coming Loop"](https://lucumr.pocoo.org/2026/6/23/the-coming-loop/) | Splits the agent loop (tool calls inside one run) from the harness loop (a system that keeps re-prompting the agent to run again). Ronacher is skeptical: loops work well for porting code, tuning performance, and scanning for security bugs, but the code they leave behind tends to be more defensive and harder to maintain, so people still have to read it and decide what to keep. |
| [LangChain — "The Art of Loop Engineering"](https://www.langchain.com/blog/the-art-of-loop-engineering) | Describes four loops built around an agent: the agent loop, a verification loop that scores the output and retries, an event-driven loop that starts agents on outside triggers, and a hill-climbing loop that reads production traces to improve the harness itself. The point: most of the value comes from these loops, not the model on its own. |
| [Andrej Karpathy — "Sequoia Ascent 2026"](https://karpathy.bearblog.dev/sequoia-ascent-2026/) | Argues for "agentic engineering": humans orchestrate and verify rather than write code. "LLMs and reinforcement learning automate what you can verify"; "you can outsource your thinking, but you can't outsource your understanding." |

### Cross-Vendor Code-Agent Engineering

Official engineering posts from other vendors building code agents — useful for seeing how the same design questions are answered outside Claude Code.

| Resource | Vendor | What's Notable |
|:---------|:-------|:---------------|
| [Harness Engineering: Leveraging Codex in an Agent-First World](https://openai.com/index/harness-engineering/) | OpenAI | Frames the "harness" as the constraints, feedback loops, and documentation that make agents reliable; reports a roughly 1M-line beta built with essentially no hand-written code. |
| [Best Practices for Coding with Agents](https://cursor.com/blog/agent-best-practices) | Cursor | Articulates an agent harness as three components — Instructions, Tools, and Model — orchestrated per model. |
| [Build with Google Antigravity](https://developers.googleblog.com/build-with-google-antigravity-our-new-agentic-development-platform/) | Google | Agent-first platform: a Manager view for asynchronous multi-agent orchestration, with Artifacts (plans, screenshots, recordings) as the verification mechanism instead of raw logs. |
| [Microsoft Agent Framework at BUILD 2026: Agent Harness, Hosted Agents, CodeAct](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/agent-framework/microsoft-agent-framework-at-build-2026-announce/) | Microsoft | Adds a built-in "agent harness" with automatic context compaction, file-based memory, plan and execute modes, skill discovery, parallel sub-agents, and a sandboxed shell. Also adds CodeAct, which lets the model run several tool calls as one Python program inside a fresh Hyperlight micro-VM each call. |
| [Codex Security: Now in Research Preview](https://openai.com/index/codex-security-now-in-research-preview/) | OpenAI | Application-security agent that builds a project-specific threat model, then finds and pressure-tests vulnerabilities in sandboxed validation environments. |

### How This Paper Differs

> While the projects above focus on **engineering reverse-engineering** or **practical reimplementation**, this paper provides a **systematic values → principles → implementation** analytical framework — tracing five human values through thirteen design principles to specific source-level choices, and using OpenClaw comparison to reveal that cross-cutting integrative mechanisms, not modular features, are the true locus of engineering complexity.
